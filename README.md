This is the repository that holds the code for running in the Eccles Ice Arena. This includes the Powerscore Server that runs on a Windows machine, the frontend that will be displayed on a larger screen, The iPad application for sending real time events to the Powerplay application, and the Entryboard project that will run on a Raspberry Pi. The frontend and Entryboard applications are created with Vue, the iPad application with Quasar, and the backend/server with Go.
